            <p>I'm a self-taught developer who quit his job as a Technical Support Specialist to pursue his dream of
                becoming a Software Engineer. I started by learning data structures and algorithms in Java, and then I
                moved on to the basics of web development. I've utilized online resources like YouTube, GeeksForGeeks,
                W3School, and LeetCode to learn everything I can. I've also learned a bit about Git, Github, ASP.NET and
                I'm currently learning Cloud like AWS.</p>
            <br>

            <p>I'm a bit of a nerd, but I'm also a lot of fun. I love learning new things, and I'm always up for a
                challenge. I'm also a great communicator, and I'm always willing to help others.</p>
            <br>

            <p>If you're looking for a developer who is passionate about their work, and who is always willing to go the
                extra mile, then I'm your guy. I'm not afraid to ask questions, and I'm always eager to learn new
                things. I'm also a great team player, and I'm always willing to help out my colleagues.</p>
            <br>

            <p>So if you're looking for a developer who is both talented and fun, then I'm your guy. I'm ready to start
                my next adventure, and I'm excited to see what the future holds.</p>
